# Agile SCRUM: Assignment

## Brief

There are two parts to this assignment. 

In part 1, you are to set up a task tracker platform with you group. As your project week is drawing near, the task tracker platform will allow you to setup product backlog and sprint backlog.

In part 2, you are to venture into research online, engage in group discussion and then produce a personal conclusion for submission.

## Part 1 - Setup Task Tracker

You are recommended to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for quick and simple setup. Everyone should create an account on Trello, but only one of you are required to setup the board (don't choose from template, just create a new board) and share the board with the rest of the group members. 

Once you are done, setup 5 columns:
1. Backlog (to add)
1. To Do (default)
1. Doing (default)
1. Reviewing (to add)
1. Done (default)

The result of it should look like this:

## Part 2 - Research and Discuss
    
Reflect on the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), phrase them in no more than five sentences in your own words.

```
1) People and communication centric, allows people with or without technical background to communicate on the same page (through visual representation).
2) Providing a working prototype rather than detailed documentation.
3) Allow for client feedback based on prototype rather than a fixed program from start to finish.
4) Accept and adapt to changes in the development process rather than be fixated over a strict plan.
```

Agile Methodology does not just apply to software development but any project management. Recollect the 12 principles of Agile and share which three principles are commonly violated in your experience and what can be done differently?

```
Changing requirements: While some change is acceptable, too much change especially late in development can cause many issues for the development team. The scrum master should communicate and mediate between the issues the development team would face as well as expectations of the product owner.

Frequent and constant updates: Unexpected bugs are likely to surface during the development process, causing delays and disruptions to updates. Development team should communicate to the scrum master/client to keep them up to date to the situation, whereas the master and owner should also exercise understanding and trust towards the development team.

simplicity: easy to lose sight of the big picture and overly focus on details during development. 


```

What are the three roles that make up a SCRUM Team? Explain the function(s) of the three roles.

```
Product Owner: Usually the client, the product owner provides the "vision" of how the product should be.
Scrum Owner: The Scrum owner manages the Scrum process and ensures also serves as a mediator between product owner and development team.
Development Team: The developers who bring the product into reality, and creates "done" stories in increments.
```

What are the SCRUM Values? 

```
Courage, focus, commitment, respect, openness
```

How many types of meetings are there in SCRUM? What is the purpose of each of them?
```
Sprint Planning Meeting: Allow Product owner to communicate their vision to the team, allow team to scope project and determine how much can be completed within the sprint. 
Daily Scrum: A max 15 minute meeting for the team to report progress and issues with their tasks. 
Sprint Review: A meeting to showcase the progress made with a live demo, and for stakeholders to suggest changes or improvements.  
Sprint Retrospective Meeting: A meeting for the team to discuss about organization and teamwork issues openly, and see how it can be improved.
Backlog Refinement Meeting: A meeting for the team to bring up issues in the backlog and refine the product.
```

## Submission Guidelines

- Cite any relevant sources consulted during your research
- Solve the problems using your own code
- Do not copy and paste solutions from the source material
